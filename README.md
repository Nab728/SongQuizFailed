## FAQ
Q: Why did you not make the youtube videos autoplay by itself rather than us having to click to start the video? <br><br>
A: Youtube TOS says you can't autoplay with sound on and only with sound off when on websites.<br><br>

Q: Why did you use the Spotify Web Api? <br><br>
A: This is because Youtube Music Videos don't follow the same format (i.e Artist Name - Title Of Song (Official Music Video)) so in order to access more accurate titles and artist we have to use spotify api. <br><br>

Q: Why didn't you just use the Spotify Web Api to play songs?<br><br>
A: Not all songs in the Spotify Web Api have a preview url and also to play songs on the web you need a premium account <br><br>

Q: Why do I need to login with my Spotify Criendentals and do all the stuff in the beginning?<br><br>
A: I would make it so I would use my own and so you don't need the client-id/secret stuff but I can't hide it from users which could be dangerous.<br>

Q: I can adjust what part of the video in the beginning. Is that a feature?<br><br>
A: I hope you don't.<br><br>

Q: I found a bug/It doesn't work?<br><br>
A: Try refreshing the page and if the bug still occurs multiple times then uhhh Idk ig I'll try to work on it.<br><br>


Q: The Answer is incorrect!!!<br><br>
A: That's mainly the title of the music video's fault so if you add your own in make sure to not have a bunch of random words in the youtube video <br><br>
